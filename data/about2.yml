title: PAN ASIAN FUSION STREET FOOD
description: "In 2018 Kayleigh & Dan started their street food journey serving up
  traditional Filipino flavours and turning them into Street Food feasts. This was
  the food Kayleigh grew up on, with a Filipino mother there was always Asian inspired
  food in the house. \n<br>As The Pork Shack evolved, they couldn’t help but add dishes
  they love from all over Asia, many of which they discovered on their year long trip
  in South East Asia. Their menus often have influences from Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines,
  Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam & more.<br>\n<br><br>Their love of street food and Asian
  cuisine inspires them to offer authentic Asian flavours with a twist!<br>\nSome
  of their most popular dishes are: Fili Burger – Filipino Adobo Pulled Pork in a
  brioche bun with pickled slaw and sriracha. Teriyaki Fries – Tender slow cooked
  chicken thighs in a Japanese style Teriyaki sauce on top of crispy fries tossed
  in a secret spice blend. Char Siu Belly Bowl – Confit Belly Pork in a sticky version
  of the infamous Cantonese Char Siu sauce served on top of coconut rice with Filipino
  pickled slaw.\n"

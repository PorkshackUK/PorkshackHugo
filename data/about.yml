  title : WHO WE ARE
  content : Dan and Kayleigh made the cliché move to take a year out and travel South East Asia and eat their way through as many different countries they could afford. The trip was “make it up as we go along” travel plan. They decided to take a detour to the Philippines to visit Kayleigh's Lola (Grandma) for her 80th birthday party, this was where they fell in love with Filipino food and the idea of the Pork Shack was born!

            Both Dan and Kayleigh have worked in the events sector but on different platforms which makes the perfect team.

            Dan is a fully trained chef and has been working in the industry for over 10 years; he has worked in restaurants, event catering, he was a personal chef and even ran his own novelty cake business.
